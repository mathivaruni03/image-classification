Jupyter Notebook for Image Classification using Data Augmentation
Image Classification using Data Augmentation 📸🧠
📌 Overview
This project demonstrates how to perform Image Classification using Data Augmentation techniques in Jupyter Notebook. Data Augmentation helps improve model performance by artificially increasing the size and diversity of the dataset.

🚀 Features
Image Classification using Deep Learning (CNN)

Data Augmentation to enhance model generalization

Keras & TensorFlow for implementation

Visualization of augmented images

Model training and evaluation

🛠️ Installation & Setup
1️⃣ Clone the Repository
Open Git Bash or a terminal and run:
git clone https://github.com/mathivaruni03/image-classification.git
cd image-classification
2️⃣ Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # For MacOS/Linux
env\Scripts\activate  # For Windows
3️⃣ Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
(If requirements.txt is not available, manually install dependencies as below.)

pip install tensorflow keras numpy matplotlib seaborn opencv-python
4️⃣ Run Jupyter Notebook
jupyter notebook
Open Image Classification with Data Augmentation.ipynb

Execute the notebook cells sequentially.

📊 Dataset Used
You can use any custom dataset or a standard dataset like CIFAR-10 or ImageNet.

Ensure your dataset is structured as:

bash
Copy
Edit
dataset/
├── train/
│   ├── class_1/
│   ├── class_2/
│   ├── ...
├── test/
│   ├── class_1/
│   ├── class_2/
│   ├── ...
📝 Implementation Steps
Load and Preprocess Dataset

Load images using ImageDataGenerator in Keras.

Resize images to a fixed dimension.

Apply Data Augmentation

Use ImageDataGenerator with transformations like:

Rotation, flipping, zooming, shifting, and shearing.

Build a CNN Model

Define a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using Keras.

Use layers like Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, Dense, and Dropout.

Compile and Train the Model

Compile using Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss.

Train using the augmented dataset.

Evaluate Model Performance

Visualize accuracy & loss curves.

Perform predictions on test data.

📈 Results & Performance
Improved model accuracy due to augmentation.

Prevents overfitting and enhances generalization.

Example augmented images:


💡 Future Enhancements
Implement Transfer Learning with pre-trained models (VGG16, ResNet, MobileNet).

Hyperparameter tuning for better performance.

Deploy the trained model as a web app.
